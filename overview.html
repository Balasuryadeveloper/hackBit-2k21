                    <p align="justify">
                        The health care industry is tremendously important to people around the world as well as to the national economies. It is one of the fastest-growing industries in the world. Consuming over 10 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) of most developed nations, a correlation exists between income levels and expenditure on health care in various countries. For example, some of the large developing economies, such as Brazil, India, China, and Russia, spend less on health care than more industrialized economies, such as the United States or France.

                    <p align="justify">
                        The modern health care sector is divided into many sub-sectors and depends on interdisciplinary teams of trained professionals and paraprofessionals to meet the health needs of individuals and populations. The health care industry is one of the world's largest and fastest-growing industries and forms an enormous part of a country's economy. The delivery of modern health care depends on groups of trained professionals and paraprofessionals coming together as interdisciplinary teams. This includes professionals in medicine, nursing, dentistry, and allied health, plus many others such as public health practitioners, community health workers, and assistive personnel, who systematically provide personal and population-based preventive, curative, and rehabilitative care services. For purposes of finance and management, the health care industry is typically divided into several areas. As a basic framework for defining the sector, the United Nations International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC) categorizes the health care industry as generally consisting of:
